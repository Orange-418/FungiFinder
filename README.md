# FungiFinder
This was a rudimentary program created by me while learning Kotlin.
This program retrieves your location, retrieves recent weather for your location, and decides what mushrooms should be fruiting (such as Chanterelles or Lions Mane).

I don't think I ever finished it, it was just a side project to learn some Kotlin.
